# visaPermission
This project is representing a list of applications that applicants sent to Czech foreign policy in order to prolong Czech longterm visa. In this sample there are 5 applicants as it was required in the project description. This list could be processed and used by different software, such as an administrating software for the Czech Foreign Ministry. When they want to check some applicants, where they have registered, have they some changes in first name or last name, were some restrictions on them. These things can be showed by processing the data from my XML file.
